## My Machine Learning Project Portfolio

I'm building my machine learning project portfolio at [Fun with ML](https://mlwithvijay.herokuapp.com/). I wanted this to sound like **Fun with Flags by Dr. Sheldon Cooper** which obviously didn't go well. Let me know if you've any suggestions.

I'm planning to use streamlit and Heroku at the moment. I plan to create a list of ML projects and want to be able to let the users navigate via the navigation drawer of Streamlit.
